Emojis Selected: Tomato / Thumbtack / Two Users / Grapes

-------- CONCEPT ------------------------------------------------------------
"Head-to-Head Fruit Popper"

Play against a friend (or the computer), squaring-off in a garden with fruit
magically growing quickly and at random. Be the fastest to pop the most fruit
with your magical thumb-tack within the time limit! Your thumb-tack has been
magically attuned to only one of two different types of fruit, while your
opponent will be seeking out the opposite type of fruit.


-------- PRESENTATION -------------------------------------------------------
2D, top-down, single-screen arena. Kind of like Bomberman without the bombs?
Players represented by character sprites that they control directly to move
around the arena. The arena will have different (non-hazardous?) obstacles
(walls), and fruit will be randomly spawning / dropping-in / etc as the game
timer counts down.

16x16 sprites/tiles.
MS-DOS VGA Mode 13h.


-------- CONTROLS -----------------------------------------------------------

Keyboard.

Single-player:
  - Arrow keys for movement, 4 directional, N/S/E/W.
  - Spacebar to use thumb-tack.

Two-player:
  - Player 1:
    - Arrow keys / Num-pad for movement.
    - Num-pad 0 / Num-pad Enter to use thumb-tack.

  - Player 2:
    - ASDW for movement
    - Spacebar to use thumb-tack.

Nice extra: Allow use of game controller (e.g. Gravis Gamepad).


-------- GAMEPLAY -----------------------------------------------------------

Players select their preferred fruit. Cannot be the same selection, so once
one player selects a fruit, the other player is automatically assigned the
other. Tomato or Grape.

Once the match begins, the main objective is to pop the most fruit matching
the player's fruit of choice.

Popping the right fruit does not cause any penalty or other sort of effect
to the other player, it simply increments the players score and the fruit
vanishes.

Popping the wrong fruit does not cause a penalty for the player that popped
it, but the player receives no score for it.

However, popping the wrong fruit causes your magically attuned thumbtack to
trigger the fruit to explode, which does not harm you, but will "splash"
toxic fruit juice over a 3x3 (TBD) tile area which will debuff the other
player if they are within that area, causing them to move at 50% speed until
the debuff wears off (2-3 seconds? TBD). Additionally, any other fruit of the
same type within a 5x5 (TBD) tile area will magically vanish. So players may
want to strategically pop the other players fruit to deny them score and slow
them down.

Players can "prick" each other with their thumbtacks. Players cannot be killed
but they can use their thumbtacks to push the other player out of the way
slightly, possibly also throwing them off a bit in the process. Pricking
another player causes them to get pushed ahead by 1-2 tiles, but causes no
other harm.

Matches are timed. Once the match is over, the score is displayed, and the
winner is the player who popped the most fruit.


-------- EXTRAS -------------------------------------------------------------

If time allows ...

- Sound effects. Use of Qbasic "SoundLab" utility to generate sound effects?
- Gravis Gamepad support
- Network play? Use of mTCP? Almost certainly won't have time for this ...
- Random "enemies" that spawn and snatch fruit before the players can get
  them? Mutant-oversized fruit flys perhaps ... ? Or some kind of Locust
  swarm maybe?
